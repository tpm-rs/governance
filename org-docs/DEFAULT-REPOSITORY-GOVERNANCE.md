#  Default Repo Governance Policy

This document provides the Default Repo Governance Policy for Repos within the
TPM-RS Project. Unless a repository contains a separate GOVERNANCE.md
file with different rules approved by the Steering Committee, this default set
of Repo Governance Rules apply.  Maintainers agree to this policy and to
abide by all Project and Repo policies, including the
[Project charter](../org-docs/CHARTER.md),
[code of conduct](../org-docs/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md),
[trademark policy](../org-docs/TRADEMARKS.md), and
[antitrust policy](../org-docs/ANTITRUST.md) by adding their name to the
[maintainers.md file](./MAINTAINERS.md).

## 1. Roles.

This repository may include the following roles. Additional roles may be adopted
and documented by individual Repos.

**1.1. Maintainers**. Maintainers are responsible for organizing activities
around developing, maintaining, and updating the Repo. Maintainers are also
responsible for determining consensus. All Maintainers must agree to the
Contributor License Agreement associated with the repository as well as the
[Project's Charter](../org-docs/CHARTER.md).

The "Maintainer" role is granted to one or more individuals by the Steering
Committee when a Repo is started.

A Repo may add or remove Maintainers with the approval of the current
Maintainers or the Steering Committee at any time.

As suggested guidance, and without limiting the foregoing, it is expected that
new Maintainers will have demonstrated a pattern of consistent positive
contributions to a Repo before being promoted to Maintainer status.

Maintainers may resign at any time with written notice to the Steering Committee
or the other Maintainers.  In addition, if a Maintainer becomes unresponsive at
its listed handle for more than three months, the remaining Maintainers or the
Steering Committee may remove that Maintainer.

**1.2. Contributors**. Contributors are those that have made contributions to
the Repo.  All Contributors must agree to the Contributor License Agreement
associated with the Repo.

The "Contributor" role is automatically acquired by any person who submits an
Approved Pull Request and executes the Contributor License Agreement in a form
acceptable to the Project, which may be electronically.

## 2. Decisions.

**2.1. Consensus-Based Decision Making**. Repos make decisions through
consensus of the Maintainers. While explicit agreement of all Maintainers is
preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Maintainers will
determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of
factors, including the dominant view of the Contributors and nature of support
and objections. The Maintainers will document evidence of consensus in
accordance with these requirements.

**2.2. Appeal Process**. Decisions may be appealed by opening an issue and that
appeal will be considered by the Maintainers in good faith, who will respond in
writing within a reasonable time. If the Maintainers deny the appeal, the appeal
may be brought before the Project Steering Committee, who will also respond
in writing in a reasonable time.

## 3. How We Work.

**3.1. Openness**. Participation is open to anyone who is directly and
materially affected by the activity in question. There shall be no undue
financial barriers to participation.

**3.2. Balance**. The development process should balance the interests of
Contributors and other stakeholders. Contributors from diverse interest
categories shall be sought with the objective of achieving balance.

**3.3. Coordination and Harmonization**. Good faith efforts shall be made to
resolve potential conflicts or incompatibility between releases in this Repo.

**3.4. Consideration of Views and Objections**. Prompt consideration shall be
given to the written views and objections of all Contributors.  However, final
decisions will rest with the Maintainers and, if appealed, the Project
Steering Committee.

**3.5. Written procedures**. This governance document and other materials
documenting this repository's development process shall be available to any
interested person.

## 4. No Confidentiality.

Information disclosed in connection with any Repo activity, except security
sensitive bug reports, including but not limited to meetings, contributions, and
submissions, is not confidential, regardless of any markings or statements to
the contrary.

## 5. Trademarks.

Any names, trademarks, logos, or goodwill developed by and associated with the
Repo (the "Marks") are controlled by the Project. Maintainers may only
use these Marks in accordance with the Project's trademark policy. If a
Maintainer resigns or is removed, any rights the Maintainer may have in the
Marks revert to the Project.

## 6. Amendments.

Amendments to this Default Repo Governance Policy may be made by decision of the
Project's Steering Committee at any time.

Amendments to any Repo specific governance policies may be made by affirmative
vote of 2/3 of all Maintainers of that Repo, subject to approval by the
Project's Steering Committee.
