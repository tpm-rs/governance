## Security Reporting Policy

Trusted Security Group (TCG) takes the security of our software products and
services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through
our GitHub organizations, which include [TPM-RS], and
[Trusted Computing Group].

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Trusted Computing
Group specification or code repository, please report it to us as described
below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the appropriate Vulnerability Response Team via
private email to:

| GitHub Organization | Contact Email |
| --- | --- |
| [Trusted Computing Group] | [security@trustedcomputinggroup.org] |
| [TPM-RS] | [security-tpm-rs@trustedcomputinggroup.org] |

You should receive a response within one business day. If for some reason you do
not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can
provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible
issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Coordinated Disclosure Practices

The Project follows multi-party coordinated disclosure practices, under which
vulnerabilities are generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are made
available to customers. This allows the industry opportunity to triage and offer
tested updates, workarounds, or other corrective measures before detailed
vulnerability or exploit information is made available to adversaries. Public
disclosure of a potential vulnerability before mitigations are deployed could
allow adversaries to exploit the vulnerability.

[TCG Vulnerability Disclosure Policy].
